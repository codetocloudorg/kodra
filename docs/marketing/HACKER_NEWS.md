Hi HN! I built Kodra because I got tired of spending hours setting up Ubuntu VMs for cloud development.

Kodra is a single command that installs and configures everything you need for Azure/cloud-native development:

wget -qO- https://kodra.codetocloud.io/boot.sh | bash

What it includes:
- Azure CLI, azd, Terraform, Bicep, OpenTofu
- Kubernetes (kubectl, Helm, k9s)  
- Docker CE with Dev Containers support
- GitHub CLI + Copilot CLI (type `??` for AI shell help)
- Modern terminal (Ghostty + Starship + Nerd Fonts)
- VS Code with 15 cloud-native extensions
- 40+ CLI tools (bat, eza, fzf, ripgrep, lazygit, etc.)

It's opinionated but consistent—same setup on every VM, every time.

Also works on WSL for Windows devs.

Would love feedback on the tool choices and any must-have tools I'm missing!
