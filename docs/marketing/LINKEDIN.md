🚀 Introducing Kodra: One-Command Azure Developer Environment

Tired of spending hours setting up new Ubuntu VMs for cloud development?

We built Kodra to solve this. One command, 10 minutes, fully-configured:

wget -qO- https://kodra.codetocloud.io/boot.sh | bash

What you get:
☁️ Azure CLI, azd, Terraform, Bicep
🐳 Docker, kubectl, Helm, k9s  
🤖 GitHub Copilot CLI for AI-assisted development
💻 Modern terminal with GPU-accelerated Ghostty
🛠️ 40+ developer tools pre-configured

Perfect for:
• Cloud engineers spinning up dev VMs
• Teams needing consistent environments
• Anyone using WSL for Azure development

Free, open source, MIT licensed.

## Version 2: Personal/Story Tone

```
I used to spend 2+ hours setting up every new Ubuntu VM for Azure development.

Installing Azure CLI, Terraform, Docker, configuring the terminal, adding VS Code extensions... every. single. time.

So I built Kodra - a single command that does it all:

wget -qO- https://kodra.codetocloud.io/boot.sh | bash

Now I go from "fresh VM" to "ready to deploy" in 10 minutes.

What's included:
• Azure CLI + azd + Terraform + Bicep
• Docker + Kubernetes tools (kubectl, Helm, k9s)
• GitHub CLI with Copilot CLI (AI in your terminal)
• Beautiful terminal with modern tools
• 40+ CLI utilities

It's free, open source, and works on both Ubuntu and WSL.

If you work with Azure on Linux, give it a try: kodra.codetocloud.io

What's in YOUR ideal dev environment setup?

## Image Recommendations

Attach one of these images (from assets/ folder):
1. `kodra-desktop.png` - Shows the full desktop
2. `kodra-terminal.png` - Shows terminal with tools
3. Create a simple graphic showing: "1 command → 40+ tools"
