## Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
I got tired of spending 2 hours setting up every new Ubuntu VM for cloud development.

So I built @kodra_dev - one command to install 40+ tools:

wget -qO- https://kodra.codetocloud.io/boot.sh | bash

Here's what it includes 🧵

## Tweet 2 (Cloud Tools)
```
☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure:

• Azure CLI + Azure Developer CLI (azd)
• Terraform, OpenTofu, Bicep
• kubectl, Helm, k9s
• Docker CE with Dev Containers

Everything pre-configured and ready to `azd up`

## Engagement Tips

1. **Post time**: 8-10 AM EST, Tuesday-Thursday
2. **Reply quickly**: First hour is critical for engagement
3. **Quote tweet**: Don't just retweet, add commentary
4. **Use thread**: Threads get 3x more engagement than single tweets
5. **Include image**: First tweet should have visual (terminal screenshot)
